def get_graph_info(adj_list):
    #adj_list is the adjacency list of a graph. It's a list of lists, with each element being the two nodes connected by an edge.
    #For example, if adj_list=[[0,1],[2,3],[4,3]], we have three edges, one connecting nodes 0 and 1, another one connecting nodes 2 and 3 and a third one connecting nodes 4 and 3.

    return 2, 0, False #fix me: for the given graph, return: maximum grade of a node, number of loops, boolean representing if there are parallel edges.
